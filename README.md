# LTCC Elements of Functional Data Analysis
This course will broadly cover topics from the area of functional data analysis, exploring theory and applications. The approach this module will take is based
on the Hilbert Space formalism and is concerned with statistical hypothesis tests in various functional data analytic settings. Theory will be motivated by examples from  various areas of science including engineering, chemistry and finance.


 
Below you can find the course outline. Every week a new set of lecture notes will be added.  At the end of each lecture, video recordings (hosted on Youtube),   script from my virtual blackboard and any R code I wrote during the session will be made available.  At the bottom of this page you can find more details on assessment, reading list, prerequisites, format etc.
